This repository belong to my school activity during my stay in Xavier University. 
I upload code that I "had written" in order for me to read back or see what I have done in the past. 
This is more like a remembrance for me to recall where I came from.

If you ever read this future me, Mr. Gerfel Jay Jimenez, this is you. 
Suffer more from embarrassment when you see this.
HAHAHAHAHAHAH :D
